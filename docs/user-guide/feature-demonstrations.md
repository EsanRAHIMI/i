## Advanced Features Demonstrations

### Demonstration 7: Federated Learning Participation

#### Understanding Federated Learning
**What happens**: Your AI learns from your patterns while keeping data private

**Voice Command**: "How is my AI getting smarter?"

**AI Response**: "Great question! I learn in two ways:
1. **Personal Learning**: I adapt to your specific preferences and speech patterns locally on your device
2. **Federated Learning**: I participate in collective learning where encrypted model updates (not your data) help improve the AI for everyone while preserving your privacy

You're currently opted into federated learning, which helps me understand diverse accents and languages better. You can opt out anytime in Settings → Privacy → Federated Learning."

#### Privacy-Preserving Learning Process
```
Your Device:
┌─────────────────┐
│ Your Voice Data │ ──┐
│ (stays local)   │   │
└─────────────────┘   │
